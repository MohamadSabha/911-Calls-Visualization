# 911-Calls-Visualization
911 is the universal emergency number in North America. Calling 911 will connect you to the local emergency services immediately (police, fire, ambulance, mountain rescue etc.). A 911 emergency is when someone needs help right away because of an injury or an immediate danger, car accident, fire accidents etc. For example, call 911 if:

• There's a fire.
• Someone has passed out.
• Someone suddenly seems very sick and is having a hard time speaking or breathing or turns blue.
• Someone is choking.
• You see a crime happening, like a break-in.
• You are in or see a serious car accident.
